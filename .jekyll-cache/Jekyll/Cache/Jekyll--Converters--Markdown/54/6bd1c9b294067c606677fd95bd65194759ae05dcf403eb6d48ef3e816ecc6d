I"G<p>I am a Ph.D. candidate at <a href="https://https://www.dtu.dk/">Danmarks Tekniske Universitet</a> (DTU) within the 
<a href="https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/organisations/energy-analytics-and-markets">Energy Markets and Analytics</a> section, 
at the Department of Wind and Energy Systems, <a href="https://www.cee.elektro.dtu.dk/">Center for Electric Power and Energy</a>.</p>

<p>My research interests include mechanism design and the economics of data within an power systems context. 
This generally inolves problems at the intersection of machine learning, optimization and game theory.</p>

<p>I hold an M.Sc. in Energy Systems and Data Analytics from 
<a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/">Univeristy College London</a>
(<a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/energy/research/energy-systems-and-artificial-intelligence-lab">Energy and Artifical Intelligence Lab</a>),
where I wrote my <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.00306">thesis</a> in collaboration with <a href="https://www.invenia.ca/labs/">Invenia Labs</a>, supervised by <a href="https://www.letifmones.com/">Dr. Letif Mones</a>.</p>

<p>Before starting my Ph.D., I worked within the Data Science team at <a href="https://www.arenko.group/">Arenko Group</a> 
developing probabilistic models to forecast wholesale electricity prices and to optimize trading 
decisions for flexible assets.</p>
