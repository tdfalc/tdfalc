I am a Ph.D. candidate at [Danmarks Tekniske Universitet](https://https://www.dtu.dk/) (DTU) within the 
[Energy Markets and Analytics](https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/organisations/energy-analytics-and-markets) section, 
at the Department of Wind and Energy Systems, [Center for Electric Power and Energy](https://www.cee.elektro.dtu.dk/) (supervised by Associate Professor [Jalal Kazempour](https://www.jalalkazempour.com/)).

My research interests include mechanism design and the economics of data within a power systems context. 
This generally inolves problems at the intersection of machine learning, optimization and game theory.

I hold an M.Sc. in Energy Systems and Data Analytics from 
[University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/)
([Energy and Artifical Intelligence Lab](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/energy/research/energy-systems-and-artificial-intelligence-lab)),
where I wrote my [thesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.00306) in collaboration with [Invenia Labs](https://www.invenia.ca/labs/), supervised by Dr. [Letif Mones](https://www.letifmones.com/).

Before starting my Ph.D., I worked within the Data Science team at [Arenko Group](https://www.arenko.group/) 
developing probabilistic models to forecast wholesale electricity prices and to optimize trading 
decisions for flexible assets.
