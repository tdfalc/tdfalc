Flipping a switch feels effortless, but behind the scenes lies a complex power system ensuring electricity flows seamlessly to homes and businesses. From generation to distribution, a vast network operates around the clock, orchestrated by market mechanisms that precisely match supply and demand to keep the lights on. In this post, we offer a brief introduction to the economics of these markets, but do bear in mind, we only slightly scratch the surface.

## A brief history
For most of the 20th century, electricity consumers had no choice but to buy power from their local utility, which operated as a monopoly. Some utilities were vertically integrated, controlling everything from generation to distribution, while others focused solely on local sales, sourcing electricity from larger regional providers. Ownership structures varied by country: some utilities were privately owned, others publicly traded, and many were government-run. Nevertheless, monopolies remained the dominant model worldwide ([Kirschen & Strbac, 2018](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Fundamentals+of+Power+System+Economics%2C+2nd+Edition-p-9781119213253)).

In the 1960's, economists began criticizing this model due to the work of [Averch & Johnson (1962)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1812181). Specifically, they showed that if regulators permit utilities to charge customers based on the cost of service plus a fixed return on capital investments (such as power plants, transmission lines, and distribution networks), when the allowed return exceeds the cost of capital, utilities are incentivized to overinvest in infrastructure, leading to "gold-plating" that results in excessive infrastructure and high costs for consumers.


 ([Averch & Johnson, 1962](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1812181)).

However, it wasn't untill the 1980's that the perception of this indsutry as natural monopoly began to change. There were three main reasons for this:
