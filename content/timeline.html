    <h1>Timeline</h1>
    <p>My life’s trajectory is summarized below:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><strong>2022 - pres.</strong> The Ph.D. journey continues...</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>2020 - 2022</strong> I worked at <a href="https://arenko.group/">Arenko Group</a> in the data
                science team. We developed probabilistic machine learning models to forecast wholesale electricity
                prices and stochastic optimzation models to algorithmically trade the power/energy of flexible assets
                (e.g., batteries). We also well developed MLOps, data engineering and data orchestration pipelines to
                productionise these operations, as well as data visualizations to communicate forecasts/recommendations
                to human traders.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>2019 - 2020</strong> I completed the M.Sc. degree in data science with application to energy
                systems at <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/">University College London</a> (<a
                    href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/energy/research/energy-systems-and-artificial-intelligence-lab">Energy
                    and Artifical Intelligence Lab</a>). During the summer, I worked as a research intern at <a
                    href="https://uk.linkedin.com/company/invenia-labs">Invenia Labs</a>, using machine learning to
                perform non-physical proprietary trading in electricity markets. It was here I wrote my <a
                    href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9810496">thesis</a> under the supervision of Dr. <a
                    href="https://www.letifmones.com/">Letif Mones</a>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>2014 - 2019</strong> I completed the B.Eng. (Hons) degree in chemical engineering at <a
                    href="https://www.hw.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/chemical-engineering-beng">Heriot-Watt University</a>
                in Edinburgh, Scotland. I was awarded the <em>Deputy Principal’s Award</em> for academic excellence, the
                <em>Chemical Engineering Departmental Prize</em> for achieving the highest overall grade in the class of
                2019 and the <em>Chevron Prize for Best Student in a Team Environment</em> for my demonstration of
                leadership, project management and team working skills. I also spent a year abroad at the <a
                    href="https://www.uva.nl/en">University of Amsterdam</a> studying statistics, economics and
                operations research.
