# Timeline

My life’s trajectory is summarized below:

- **2022 - pres.** The Ph.D. journey continues...

- **2020 - 2022**  I worked at [Arenko Group](https://arenko.group/) in the data science team. We developed probabilistic machine learning models to forecast wholesale electricity prices and stochastic optimzation models to algorithmically trade the power/energy of flexible assets (e.g., batteries). We also well developed MLOps, data engineering and data orchestration pipelines to productionise these operations, as well as data visualizations to communicate forecasts/recommendations to human traders.

- **2019 - 2020**  I completed the M.Sc. degree in data science with application to energy systems at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/)  ([Energy and Artifical Intelligence Lab](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/energy/research/energy-systems-and-artificial-intelligence-lab)). During the summer, I worked as a research intern at [Invenia Labs](https://uk.linkedin.com/company/invenia-labs), using machine learning to perform non-physical proprietary trading in electricity markets. It was here I wrote my [thesis](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9810496) under the supervision of Dr. [Letif Mones](https://www.letifmones.com/).

- **2014 - 2019**  I completed the B.Eng. (Hons) degree in chemical engineering at [Heriot-Watt University](https://www.hw.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/chemical-engineering-beng) in Edinburgh, Scotland. I was awarded the *Deputy Principal’s Award* for academic excellence, the *Chemical Engineering Departmental Prize* for achieving the highest overall grade in the class of 2019 and the *Chevron Prize for Best Student in a Team Environment* for my demonstration of leadership, project management and team working skills. I also spent a year abroad at the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en) studying statistics, economics and operations research.
