                <h2>Mechanism Design for Trading Information</h2>

                Machine learning assisted optimal power flow (OPF)
                aims to reduce the computational complexity of these non-linear
                and non-convex constrained optimization problems by consigning
                expensive (online) optimization to offline training. The majority of
                work in this area typically employs fully connected neural networks
                (FCNN). However, recently convolutional (CNN) and graph (GNN)
                neural networks have also been investigated, in effort to exploit
                topological information within the power grid. Although promising
                results have been obtained, there lacks a systematic comparison
                between these architectures throughout literature. Accordingly,
                we introduce a concise framework for generalizing methods for
                machine learning assisted OPF and assess the performance of a
                variety of FCNN, CNN and GNN models for two fundamental
                approaches in this domain: regression (predicting optimal generator set-points) and classification
                (predicting the active set of
                constraints). For several synthetic power grids with interconnected
                utilities, we show that locality properties between feature and target
                variables are scarce and subsequently demonstrate marginal utility
                of applying CNN and GNN architectures compared to FCNN for a
                fixed grid topology. However, with variable topology (for instance,
                modeling transmission line contingency), GNN models are able to
                straightforwardly take the change of topological information into
                account and outperform both FCNN and CNN models.
